        <h3>How to stylishly mix black and white pieces</h3><br>
        <p>One of the hottest and easiest trends to try this summer is the classic black and white combination. The two shades, which just happen to work effortlessly together, may seem bland at first glance but there are various ways to wear the duo and
            weâ€™re here to help lay out the best ways you can master the style.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Stripes </b></h4><br> This is the most obvious one, but most effective too. Black and white stripes, preferably horizontal, look good on everyone (based on the line thickness) and this trust-worthy pattern is also a must to have in your closet
        since it goes with about anything and everything from skinny colored jeans to pencil skirts. Note: feel free to try vertical stripes to if you feel really daring!.

            </h6><br><br>
            <p>Ahead of Sunday's derby away to Espanyol, Barcelona head coach <b>Xavi Hernandez</b> is considering going with a new-look front three comprised of recent signings <b>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</b>, <b>Ferran Torres</b> and<b> Adama Traore</b>.
                The Catalan coach is certainly not short of options in attack and one his biggest dilemmas between now and the end of the season will be picking his trident of choice for each match, and perhaps to even settle on a first choice for the
                biggest games and to enter next season with.

            <div>
                <p>Without counting the injured <b>Ansu Fati</b>, <b>Xavi </b>has 10 players vying for those three jerseys every week:<b> Memphis Depay</b>,<b> Ousmane Dembele</b>, <b>Luuk de Jong</b>, <b>Ferran Torres</b>, <b>Aubameyang</b>, <b>Adama</b>,
                    <b> Abde Ezzalzouli</b>, <b>Ferran Jutgla</b> and<b> Gavi</b>. For the derby on Sunday, the idea is to combine the three new signings from the start for the first time. Against Atletico Madrid last Sunday, <b>Aubameyang</b> began on
                    the bench due to his lack of game time, with <b>Gavi</b> joining <b>Adama</b> and <b>Ferran Torres</b> in attack. <b>Aubameyang</b> is available to start against Los Periquitos, however, while <b>Memphis</b> will not be back in time,
                    but <b>Xavi</b> does hope to have the Dutchman for the Napoli game four days later.
